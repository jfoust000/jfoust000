Hi, I’m @jfoust000
I’m interested in Software Development, playing video games, cooking, producing music, and working out.
I'm currently working on some personal projects - to build a portfolio as I continue to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’m also interested in collaborating on Web based applications - to gain experience developing front-end and full stack applications.

How to reach me:
